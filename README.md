*A github repository for the Brain Connectivity Toolbox*

The Brain Connectivity Toolbox
([brain-connectivity-toolbox.net](http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net/))
is a MATLAB toolbox for complex-network analysis of structural and
functional brain-connectivity data sets.

## Installation

#### With git

Just type this command into your terminal:

`git clone git@github.com/mikarubi/bct.git`

If you don't have `git`, [get it](https://git-scm.com/downloads)!

Make sure you add the `BCT/` directory to your matlab path.

#### As a .zip

[Download the BCT in zip form](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/Home/functions/BCT.zip?attredirects=0).
